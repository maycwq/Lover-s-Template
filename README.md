The "_css" folder has just style, you don't need to change anything. The folder "_elements" also doesn't need to be changed. The same goes with "_favicon". Changes can be made to the "inicial" file and all those contained in the "_pages" folder, for this:

1) Click on it with the right side of the mouse;
2) Select "Properties";
3) In "Open with:" click on "Change" and among the selected options choose the text editor you prefer;
4) Click "Ok", then "Apply";
5) Ready! Now just click on the file and make the necessary changes. More important instructions below! 😘❤️🧡💛💚💙💜

Instructions:

- To change the texts, just select what is between the h1 tags (for titles) and the p tags (for paragraphs);
- In the file "03czxWFqlQE8AM.html" contained in the folder "_pages" replace "your_password" with the password you want people to discover to give access to the next page. Also replace the text contained in "placeholder" with the tip you want to give.

Hope you like the template!
